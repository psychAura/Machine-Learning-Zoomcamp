Linear Regression

Overview

This project is part of the Machine Learning Zoomcamp and focuses on implementing Linear Regression for predictive modeling. The goal is to understand the relationship between variables and build a model that can make accurate predictions based on given input data.

Contents
	•	📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding data distributions and relationships.
	•	🏗 Feature Engineering: Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, normalization).
	•	📈 Model Training: Implementing Simple and Multiple Linear Regression using Scikit-Learn.
	•	📉 Model Evaluation: Assessing performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE), R² score, etc.
	•	📊 Data Visualization: Scatter plots, regression lines, and residual plots for insights.

Technologies Used
	•	🐍 Python
	•	📚 NumPy & Pandas (Data manipulation)
	•	📈 Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data visualization)
	•	🤖 Scikit-Learn (Model training & evaluation)
	•	📓 Jupyter Notebook (Code execution & analysis)
